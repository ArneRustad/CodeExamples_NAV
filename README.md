# Coding examples for NAV IT
In this repository I have collected some examples of code written previously. Context: an application for a summer internship 2020 with NAV IT.

Example 1 and 2 is taken from projects in a course in scientific computing.

In addition I also uploaded a few different excercises. The one from the algorithms and data structures course is written in the programming language Julia. The rest are written in Python.
